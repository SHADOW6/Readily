    <string name="sample_text"> Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron.
        The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.
        Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.
        The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed) but there was no way of shutting it off completely.
        He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure,
        the meagerness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party.
        His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine,
        his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.</string>
