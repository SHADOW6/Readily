#ReadIt!

##Welcome :)

**ReadIt!** is a speed-reading android application powered by [RSVP] technology and inspired by [Spritzer] app.

With this technology you can read up to 1000 words per minute instead of 220 when reading normally. 

##Instructions

To start reading copy some the text to clipboard or choose `.txt` file from your filesystem (*this action actually requires file manager*). 

To pause or play, slightly swipe on the reader window. You can scroll through a text using either button or left and right swipe.

To change speed on the go, swipe a bit harder up or down. Step is 50 wpm.

##Features

List of functions already implemented:

* Splitting of long words (*max length of word is not currently optional, default value is 13*).
* Speed change before punctuation, in the beginning of a paragraph and on long words (*optional*).
* Preview of next words in paragraph, line clears when paragaph ends (*opitonal*).

##Supported sources of text:

* Clipboard
* `.txt`
* `.epub`(*alpha*).
* `.html`

##Languages supported

* English
* Russian
* Ukrainian

If you know some other language and want to help me - please, [contact me], I'd appreciate it a lot!

##TODO:

Well, I'm trying to design very flexible and powerful app, so demands are really ambitious sometimes: 

* Parse all e-book formats
* Improve html parsing, e.g. take all pages, instead of 1
* Add some nice themes
* Implement some storage of incomplete readings

# **Have fun!**
